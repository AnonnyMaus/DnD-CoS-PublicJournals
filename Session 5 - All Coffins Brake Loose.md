# Session Overview

# Session Overview

The missing bones investigation takes a violent and disastrous turn as Vallaki falls under attack, leading to a desperate race against time and the devil Strahd himself.

## The Narrative
The session opened in the custody of the town guard, where more light was shed on the brutal Captain of the Guard, [[izek-strazni-cos|Izek Strazni]]. Izek doubled down on his claim to be [[Nirthar]]'s brother, revealing his tragic backstory: he claims to have been dreaming about Nirthar ever since their family tried to escape Vallaki. They were chased by a pitchfork-wielding mob due to the children's devilish features, and Izek was lost in the woods during the chaotic escape. Izek's personality proved to be wildly unexpected—he acts intensely macho to cover up deep insecurities, behaves like an extremely shallow "fitness bro," and bizarrely speaks in street-rap lingo mixed heavily with French. 

With the hunters' confession guiding them, the party finally located the coffin shop. They initially met [[henrik-van-der-voort-cos|Henrik van der Voort]] at a closed door, where he was completely unwilling to speak to them. However, the moment they mentioned the sacred bones, Henrik opened the door. The party saw a man who used to be strong and proud, but who had completely fallen into ruin due to constant stress. Scared out of his mind, Henrik immediately confessed that he had hoped the bones could protect him "from what is in his attic," insisting he never meant anyone no harm, before abruptly running off. 

At that moment, the party heard heavy movement upstairs and went to investigate. They tried to be stealthy, but [[Tildrak Pagrax|Tildrak]] made far too much noise. The disastrously failed stealth check immediately woke the creatures: the "filled coffins" hidden in the attic burst open, and a vicious pack of [[vampire-spawn|Vampire Spawn]] broke loose, spilling out into the streets to attack the [[Town of Vallaki]].

Just as the chaos erupted, [[ireena-kolyana-cos|Ireena Kolyana]] came running towards them through the panicked streets. Amidst the screams and confusion, she cryptically but urgently told the party that they absolutely had to reinstate the hallowed ground at St. Andral's church. 

With Vallaki descending into panic, a deadly sprint began. The party frantically grabbed the bones and raced back towards the church, pursued relentlessly by the hungry vampires. The chaotic chase played out through unique game mechanics: the party endured grueling rounds of sprinting, dodging hazards, and avoiding obstacles in a desperate bid to reach hallowed ground before the arrival of Strahd—who was dramatically approaching the town riding a flaming horse.

[[Nirthar]] and [[Vinarius Vinebloom|Vinarius]] managed to successfully reach the crypt to re-sanctify the church. They were crucially aided by the young altar boy Yeska, who shockingly pulled out a set of lockpicks and expertly unsealed the church's strongbox in the heat of the moment, leading the party to assume he had a shadowy past. 


As the bones were placed in their rightful resting place, the hallowed power was restored with immense force. A massive "sonic boom" wave of holy energy blasted outward, racing through the streets of Vallaki and instantly scattering the remaining Vampire Spawn, forcing them to flee the town.

Outside the church, [[Tildrak Pagrax|Tildrak]] bravely stood his ground, attempting to protect [[ireena-kolyana-cos|Ireena Kolyana]] from Strahd. The effort was noble but futile. With a single, effortless fling, the vampire lord threw Tildrak against a wall, instantly knocking him out. Seeing the party so hopelessly outmatched, Ireena made a tragic sacrifice: she agreed to go willingly along with Strahd in order to save the party's lives. 

## The Facts
*   **Izek's Past:** Izek Strazni revealed his origin story of fleeing a Vallaki mob alongside Nirthar due to their fiendish features. He presents a bizarre "French gym-bro" street persona to mask his insecurities.
*   **Henrik's Confession:** The party confronted Henrik at his shop. A broken, terrified man, he revealed he stole the bones hoping they would protect him from the monsters living in his attic.
*   **The Vampire Breakout:** The party went to investigate the attic, but Tildrak's noisy armor botched their stealth attempt, causing the coffins to burst open and unleashing a pack of Vampire Spawn upon Vallaki.
*   **Ireena's Warning:** Ireena found the party amidst the breakout and urgently instructed them to reinstate the hallowed ground.
*   **The Hallowed Sprint:** The party survived a grueling, obstacle-filled chase sequence to beat the vampires and Strahd to the church. Nirthar, Vinarius, and Yeska successfully re-sanctified St. Andral's, unleashing a holy sonic boom that drove all remaining vampires out of Vallaki.
*   **Yeska's Lockpicking:** The seemingly timid choir boy Yeska expertly picked the lock on the church strongbox, raising suspicions about his past.
*   **Tildrak's Defeat:** Tildrak attempted to fight Strahd alone and was effortlessly knocked unconscious.
*   **Ireena's Sacrifice:** To save the party from being slaughtered, Ireena Kolyana willfully surrendered herself to Strahd.

## Open Questions
*   Where is Strahd taking Ireena, and what will he do with her?
*   What other secrets is the young altar boy Yeska hiding?
