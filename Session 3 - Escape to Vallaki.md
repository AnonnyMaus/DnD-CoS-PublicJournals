# Session Overview

This session covered the party's tense journey out of the Village of Barovia, their fateful meeting with the Vistani at Tser Pool, and their eventual arrival in the walled town of Vallaki to secure Ireena's safety.

## The Narrative
Tasked with protecting Ireena Kolyana from the devil Strahd, the party—Tildrak, Vinarius, and Nirthar—set out from the gloomy Village of Barovia. Their journey along the Old Svalich Road led them to the River Ivlis crossroads. There, they encountered an old, creaking gallows. As they prepared to leave, a haunting illusion manifested: one of the party members heard the snap of a neck, turned, and saw the gray, dead body of Tildrak hanging from the noose, before it suddenly vanished.

Continuing down the muddy, heavily-rutted road, they arrived at the Vistani encampment at Tser Pool. The camp was a mix of melancholic accordion music and boisterous singing around the fire, where a dozen off-duty bandits were getting drunk. 

They were soon invited into the large tent of the ancient seer, **Madam Eva**. Rather than a simple fortune teller, she proved incredibly perceptive, addressing each adventurer by their full name and tearing into their deepest flaws:
*   She called out **Vinarius** for using his search for "new grapes" as an excuse to avoid reality and stay perpetually drunk.
*   She goaded **Nirthar** about the irony of the actual devil locking him in a land where the locals view Tieflings as his spawn.
*   She mocked **Tildrak**, the self-proclaimed disciple of Tyr, for offering no "justice" to the companions forced to travel with a "socially awkward creep."
*   And she pitied **Ireena**, warning her that the Dark One had his eyes fixed upon her.

After serving them tea infused with grapes, Madam Eva performed a Tarokka card reading, revealing vague but crucial prophecies regarding the tools and allies they would need to defeat Strahd:

*   **The Artifact of History:** She drew the *6 of Coins - Beggar*. "A wounded elf has what you seek. He will part with the treasure to see his dark dreams fulfilled."

*   **The Force for Good:** She drew the *4 of Stars - Abjurer*. "I see a fallen house guarded by a great stone dragon. Look to the highest peak."

*   **The Weapon of Vengeance:** She drew the *8 of Glyphs - Bishop*. "What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors."

*   **The Ally against Darkness:** She prophesied that they must find an eccentric man named Rictavio, telling them: "After your pilgrimage, find the tower in the center of the lake."

Armed with these cryptic goals, the party continued their dangerous escort mission. They finally reached the gates of **Vallaki**, a town that outwardly professes that "All will be well" under the rule of its Burgomaster, Baron Vallakovich. Making their way through the town square, they witnessed the dark reality of this mandatory happiness: a local peasant was locked in the public stocks, surrounded by guards. Inquiring about his crime, they learned he had failed to attend the latest municipal festival. As they pressed the guards about these draconian laws, the party nearly got themselves arrested for "malicious unhappiness," but managed to de-escalate the situation and get off with a stern warning.

Sobered by the oppressive atmosphere, they hurried to their primary destination. They successfully delivered Ireena into the care of **Father Lucian Petrovich** at the Church of St. Andral, hoping the consecrated ground would keep her safe from Strahd's grasp.

However, safety is rarely guaranteed in Barovia. Bonding as fellow holy men, Father Lucian pulled Tildrak aside to confess a terrible secret he desperately needed dealt with discretely. The sacred bones of St. Andral, the very relics that made the church hallowed ground, had been stolen. Father Lucian revealed he has two initial suspects in mind for the theft: the gruff gravedigger **Milivoj** and the young altar boy **Yeska**.

## The Facts
*   **The Crossroads Gallows:** The party witnessed a dark illusion of a dead friend hanging from the gallows at the Ivlis crossroads.
*   **Escort Complete:** Ireena was successfully escorted from the Village of Barovia to Vallaki and dropped off at the Church of St. Andral with Father Lucian.
*   **Madam Eva's Judgement:** Madam Eva personally mocked the flaws of Vinarius, Nirthar, and Tildrak.
*   **Tarokka Reading Received:** The party learned the locations of the three core artifacts and their destined ally. 
*   **Mandatory Happiness:** The party learned that Vallaki enforces mandatory attendance at weekly festivals, witnessing a man in the stocks over it. They narrowly avoided being arrested themselves.
*   **The Missing Bones:** Father Lucian revealed the church's sacred bones have been stolen, removing its hallowed protection. Milivoj and Yeska are the prime suspects.

## Open Questions
*   Is Ireena truly safe within the walls of Vallaki given the loss of the church's hallowed ground?
*   Who stole the sacred bones, and can the party recover them before Strahd finds out?
*   Where are the "amber doors", the "stone dragon", and the "wounded elf" mentioned by Madam Eva?
