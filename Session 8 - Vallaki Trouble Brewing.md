# Session Overview

The party returns to Vallaki to execute a stealthy jailbreak for Urwin Martikov, but the plan quickly devolves into a bloody massacre that strains their alliances and sets the town on fire.

## The Narrative
Before leaving Yester Hill, the party discovered a secretive [[vrock]] nest hidden among the crags. Inside the foul lair, they uncovered a stash of remarkable loot. Strangely, each item seemed perfectly tailored to a specific member of the party: the silent crossbow *Whisperfang* for the stealthy [[Nirthar]], the *Thornskin Bramblecloak* for the shapeshifting druid [[Vinarius Vinebloom|Vinarius]], and the *Justicebrand Gauntlet* for the paladin [[Tildrak Pagrax|Tildrak]]. The party also secured two unhatched Vrock eggs.

After securing their new gear from the nest, the party traveled back to the Wizard of Wines winery, hoping to deliver the good news. However, finding the winery completely abandoned, they decided to return to Vallaki, arriving in the dead of night. 

After a tense standoff at the town gates, they managed to gain entry by invoking the name of Izek Strazni. Heading straight to the Blue Water Inn, they met with [[danika-dorakova-cos|Danika Dorakova]] and received horrible news: her husband [[Urwin Matrikov]] had been arrested and was scheduled to be hanged. Urwin had been responsible for supplying Vallaki with wine to calm the populace after the vampire attack. Because the party had only just retrieved the missing gem from Yester Hill and hadn't yet returned with the wine, Urwin had failed to deliver. Feeling directly responsible for his impending execution, the party hatched a daring plan to break him out of the Vallaki dungeon. The multifaceted infiltration plan involved:
*   [[Nirthar]] intentionally getting himself arrested for disturbing the peace to get inside.
*   [[Vinarius Vinebloom|Vinarius]] shapeshifting into a [[lizard|Lizard]] to sneak into the cellblocks.
*   [[Borgür]] (acting 'off-screen' as his player was absent) working with Danika to create a massive diversion by setting the guardhouse on fire, intending to draw the prison guards outside.
*   [[Tildrak Pagrax|Tildrak]] waiting outside in position, ready to infiltrate once Borgür's fire had successfully distracted and drawn the guards away.

Predictably in Barovia, the plan immediately fell apart. Instead of waiting for the fire diversion to draw the guards away, an impatient Tildrak tried to bluff his way in by convincing the guards he was a priest arriving to give last rites. He failed miserably, but refused to take no for an answer. After pestering them relentlessly, the guards finally lost their patience and gave Tildrak a brutal kicking. Inside the dungeon, Vinarius and Nirthar initially maintained stealth, but the chaotic situation quickly spiraled. The hunters [[szoldar-szoldarovich-cos|Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[yevgeni-krushkin-cos|Yevgeni Krushkin]] became involved in the scuffle. A desperate Vinarius unleashed a [[thunderwave]], sounding the alarms and triggering an absolute bloodbath. 

Hearing the commotion, Tildrak forced his way inside, maiming the gate guard and slaying two more inside. By the time they escaped the dungeon, the party had gone on a murder spree, leaving behind seven dead bodies, two permanently maimed guards, and one heavily wounded survivor. During the chaos, Szoldar betrayed the party, and the party in turn betrayed Yevgeni (though Vinarius tossed him the keys so he could free himself). 

The fallout was disastrous. [[Urwin Matrikov]] was disgusted by the slaughter he had witnessed. The guards weren't just faceless soldiers; they were regulars at his inn, decent men with families of their own. For [[izek-strazni-cos|Izek Strazni]], the betrayal cut even deeper. These were not just subordinates, but his friends and long-time colleagues who had survived many dangerous excursions into Vallaki together. Livid with grief and fury, an enraged Izek confronted Nirthar, formally disowning him as a brother and vowing to exact his revenge against the party for the massacre of his men. 

Returning to the Inn, the debrief immediately erupted into an argument between Urwin and Danika. Danika revealed three shocking developments:
1.  The diversion fire they set at the guardhouse had spread out of control to nearby buildings, and the town desperately needed helping hands to put it out.
2.  She confessed she had been secretly planning a rebellion to empower Lady Fiona Wachter. Sick of the dictatorial Burgomaster and his awful, draconian rules, Danika firmly believes Fiona would be an improvement. Urwin strongly distrusts the alliance, unable to put his finger exactly on why, but nervously waiting for the other shoe to drop.
3.  She plans to meet with the furious Izek Strazni to see if the Vallaki military can be convinced to join her rebellion against the Baron.


Knowing they had just slaughtered Izek's men, the party wisely advised Danika that she should probably take that meeting alone, while they went out to help fight the roaring fires consuming Vallaki.

## The Facts
*   **The Vrock Nest:** Before leaving Yester Hill, the party looted a hidden Vrock nest, finding three powerful magic items uniquely suited to Tildrak, Vinarius, and Nirthar, along with two Vrock eggs.
*   **The Wine Crisis:** Urwin Martikov was arrested and sentenced to hang for failing to provide Vallaki with wine. The party initiated the jailbreak out of deep guilt, knowing it was their delayed quest that caused his arrest.
*   **A Bloody Jailbreak:** The plan to stealthily free Urwin Martikov devolved into a massacre, resulting in 7 dead and 3 wounded guards. Tildrak, Nirthar, and Vinarius were all involved in the slaughter.
*   **Shattered Alliances:** [[Urwin Matrikov]] is utterly disgusted by the party's murderous actions against the guards, who were good men and regulars at his inn. Furthermore, Szoldar betrayed the party, and the party betrayed Yevgeni. 
*   **Izek's Vow:** Izek Strazni, furious over the slaughter of his veteran colleagues and close friends, formally disowned Nirthar as his brother and promised revenge against the party.
*   **Vallaki Ablaze:** The distraction fire set by Borgür and Danika spread, threatening to burn down nearby buildings in Vallaki.
*   **Danika's Rebellion:** Danika revealed a secret plot to overthrow the Baron and empower Lady Fiona Wachter, and plans to court Izek's military support.

## Open Questions
*   Will the party be able to extinguish the fires before Vallaki burns down?
*   How will Lady Fiona Wachter and the Baron react to the dungeon massacre?
*   Can Danika really convince a furious Izek Strazni to join her rebellion after the party just slaughtered his guards?
