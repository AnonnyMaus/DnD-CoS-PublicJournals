# Session Overview

As the party prepares to leave Vallaki on their pilgrimage, Baron Vallakovich is publicly ousted. In a desperate final move, his son Victor inadvertently summons a massive Hezrou demon. With their newly awakened divine powers, the heroes slay the beast. Afterward, they rescue a Vistani child, Arabelle, from undead in the Svalich Woods, earning the gratitude of her family.

## The Narrative

### The Fall of the Baron and Victor's Last Stand

The morning after the trial, the heroes awoke refreshed and ready for their pilgrimage. Nirthar was noticeably absent. Instead, an emissary of Fiona Wachter arrived and told the remaining party members to go ahead, assuring them that Nirthar would catch up with them later. *(Note: Nirthar's player was not present for this session.)*


They headed into town, only to find Fiona Wachter’s coup in its final stages. A furious, half-drunk Baron Vallakovich was dragged out of his home into the mud, screaming at the townsfolk and guards who had abandoned him for "demon spawn" Fiona.

In a desperate, chaotic bid to regain control, his son Victor appeared in an upper window, clutching a high-level conjuration scroll he barely understood. He triggered the glyph, tearing reality open and summoning a massive, abyssal Hezrou demon. Instead of obeying Victor, the toad-like beast laughed in his face and immediately began spreading corruption.

The heroes rolled for initiative.

During the fierce battle—at least according to Vinarius's highly exaggerated retelling of events, where he was supposedly the undeniable MVP with his flawless tactical casting—both Tildrak and Borgür discovered new, radiant powers:
*   Tildrak realized his **Mark of Atonement** sparked with golden light, allowing his sword to bite much deeper into the fiend with radiant energy.
*   Borgür found that his new spectral hawk familiar required his constant focus, lest it simply fly away. However, it also imbued his strikes with radiant power—the exact weakness of the overgrown Abyssal toad.

After heavy brawling, the "brilliant wine-connoisseur and MVP Vinarius" (again, his words...) delivered the final, decisive blow to the fiend. 

From the Hezrou's corpse, the party looted an **Abyssal Pearl** that emitted a foul, stinking gas. They discovered that exposure to this pearl caused Borgür's shadowy phantom hand to temporarily manifest as solid, red flesh. Finding this deeply unsettling, Borgür rejected it, and Vinarius pocketed the pearl instead.


While the others supposedly stood in awe of his sheer awesomeness, Vinarius rushed up to the mansion's top floor and cast *Entangle* to prevent Victor from escaping. After applying some "subtle" physical persuasion, they learned Victor truly, foolishly believed he could control the demon. Vinarius demanded answers about the encrypted summoning book he had stolen from Fiona's house (which he had spent the previous night studying to little avail), but Victor offered no explanation. Vinarius kept the book regardless.

### A Plea on the Road

Leaving Vallaki behind, Vinarius questioned if their new radiant abilities were somehow connected to the strange portal where Borgür lost his hand (remembering the vision: *"return when you acquired the power of the sun"*). The others weren't convinced, and they pressed on.

A half-mile outside Vallaki, they encountered a frantic Vistani woman on horseback named Lara. Borgür cast *Animal Friendship* to calm her horse, while Vinarius smoothly applied *Speak with Animals* to get straight to the point. 

Lara explained her daughter, Arabelle, had chased a strange blue light into the woods near Lake Zarovich and vanished. While searching, Lara had been swarmed by walking corpses. 

The heroes immediately stepped up. Tildrak summoned his steed, Borgür sent his spectral hawk to scout, and they tracked Arabelle toward the river.

### The Drowned Ones of Zarovich

Near the water, the party was ambushed by waterlogged zombies dripping with lake weed. Tildrak unleashed a powerful *Turn Undead*, instantly neutralizing a large portion of the horde. 

Using his survival skills, Borgür spotted a trail through the brush. As night fell, they reached a clearing where a group of zombies surrounded a hollow tree stump. Vinarius executed a perfectly stealthy, miniaturized *Fireball*, and the heroes swiftly dispatched the remaining undead.

Inside the hollow stump, a terrified Arabelle was successfully rescued. Reunited, a tearful and relieved Lara lovingly chided her daughter: *"Arabelle, you foolish girl."*

Arabelle couldn't explain why the blue light compelled her so strongly, but she did share two cryptic premonitions with her rescuers:
> **“Your friend… the quiet one… he’s walking a dangerous road.”**
> 
> **“Someone waits for you in the mountains. A broken angel.”**

Though Lara had no material wealth to offer, she expressed her profound gratitude and invited the heroes back to their nearby Vistani camp to rest for the night.

## The Facts
*   **The Baron Falls:** Baron Vallakovich has been officially stripped of his power, sealing Fiona Wachter's control over Vallaki.
*   **Victor Arrested:** After summoning a rogue Hezrou demon, Victor was apprehended by the party and arrested. 
*   **Radiant Awakenings:** Tildrak's Mark of Atonement and Borgür's new spectral hawk are granting them potent radiant damage against fiends.
*   **The Abyssal Pearl:** Vinarius holds an Abyssal Pearl looted from the Hezrou that can temporarily solidify Borgür's ghost hand into red flesh.
*   **Arabelle Rescued:** The party saved Arabelle from lake zombies, earning significant favor with her Vistani family.

## Open Questions
*   What secrets are hidden in the encrypted summoning book Vinarius is carrying?
*   Are the party's new radiant powers tied to the mysterious portal that claimed Borgür's hand?
*   How will the Vistani camp receive the heroes after rescuing Arabelle?
