# Session Overview

In the devastating aftermath of the Vallaki vampire attack, the party is sent to the Wizard of Wines winery to secure much-needed alcohol to calm the panicking populace, only to find the vineyard under siege by a horde of blights and mad druids.

## The Narrative
The vampire spawn attack on Vallaki left a severe toll on the town. Many lives were lost, and more importantly, the Baron's enforced facade that "just keeping smiling" will keep the devil away was utterly shattered. With the populace dissolving into panic, the Mayor desperately demanded a new shipment of wine to numb and calm the people. He directed his immense anger squarely at [[urwin-martikov-cos|Urwin Martikov]], the barkeep of the Blue Water Inn, accusing him of being on the verge of betraying his responsibilities to the town by running out of alcohol. In reality, Urwin was deeply worried; the expected wine shipment from his father, Davian, was extremely late, leading Urwin to suspect something very bad had happened at the winery. He tasked the party to go investigate the Wizard of Wines.

Right before leaving Vallaki, the party passed by the Burgomaster's manor house. Suddenly, a magical bang echoed from the second floor, accompanied by a bright flash of light and a loud argument. A voice yelled, *"Noo! What do you do here? I did not summon you! You imbecile, you disrupted the whole ritual!"* Immediately after, [[Borgür]] was thrown out of the second-story window, landing in an unceremonious heap at the party's feet. Deeply confused but shrugging off the sheer absurdity of the situation, Borgür decided to join the group as they headed out of town.


Arriving near the winery, the party met the patriarch, **Davian Martikov**, along with his daughter Stefania and her fiercely anti-alcohol husband, Tomescu, hiding in the nearby woods. Davian informed them that evil druids and blights had violently driven the family out of their own home and poisoned the vats.

Approaching the building, the party was swarmed by dozens of Needle Blights, forcing them to push their way inside the winery to survive. Once inside, they battled through the facility, eventually confronting an evil, wildly drunk mad druid babbling at the loading winch. Realizing the man was too intoxicated to reason with normally, Vinarius expertly matched the druid's level of drunkenness, allowing him to understand the druid's ramblings and deduce how to command the **Gulthias Staff**. Seizing the evil staff from the druid, the party intentionally snapped and destroyed it, instantly instantly turning the remaining Needle Blight horde to ash and successfully clearing the winery.

With the immediate threat neutralized, Davian Martikov revealed two massive secrets to the party. First, he confessed that the entire Martikov family belongs to a secret order of Lycanthropes known as the **Keepers of the Feather**—they are Wereravens working against Strahd. Second, he revealed the true stakes of the conflict: the secret history of the vineyard. The rich, sweet grapevines were magically sustained by three pinecone-sized gems planted in the soil by an ancient, forgotten wizard. Without these gems, the winery cannot produce its three famous vintages (Purple Grapemash No. 3, Red Dragon Crush, and Champagne du le Stomp). 

Davian confessed that all three gems were now missing. While he doesn't know for absolute certain who took each one, he has strong suspicions:
1.  **The Champagne Gem:** Stolen a decade ago. Davian bitterly blames his estranged son **Urwin Martikov** (the Blue Water Innkeeper in Vallaki), whom he claims abandoned his watch to court his bride.
2.  **The Red Dragon Gem:** Stolen a few months ago. Davian suspects a witch living in the swamps, noting that the theft coincided with attacks by terrifying scarecrows.
3.  **The Purple Grapemash Gem:** Stolen just weeks ago by the evil druids, who carried it off to **Yester Hill**.

Davian informed the party that before any wine can be escorted back to Vallaki, they must travel to Yester Hill and retrieve the stolen gem from the druids.

## The Facts
*   **Vallaki in Chaos:** The vampire attack shattered the Baron's "all will be well" illusions. The panicking Mayor threatened Urwin for running out of wine.
*   **The Late Shipment:** Tasked by a worried Urwin, the party prepared to travel to the Wizard of Wines winery to investigate the missing alcohol shipment.
*   **A New Companion:** Passing the Burgomaster's manor, [[Borgür]] was quite literally ejected from a second-story window into the party's path after a magical explosion. Confused, he joined the group.
*   **The Siege of the Winery:** The party found the Martikov family hiding in the woods, driven from their home. The party then fought through thirty-plus Needle Blights and killed the evil druids occupying the Wizard of Wines.
*   **Drunken Insight:** Vinarius matched the mad druid's extreme drunkenness to decipher how to use the Gulthias Staff.
*   **The Gulthias Staff:** The party seized and intentionally destroyed the evil staff, instantly destroying the remaining Needle Blight horde in the process.
*   **The Keepers of the Feather:** Davian confessed that the Martikov family are actually a secret society of Wereravens fighting against Strahd.
*   **The Three Gems:** Davian revealed the vineyard is powered by three stolen magical gems. He blames Urwin for the first, suspects a swamp witch with scarecrows for the second, and knows the druids took the third to Yester Hill.
*   **A New Quest:** The party must assault Yester Hill to retrieve the third gem before wine can flow back to Vallaki.

## Open Questions
*   Will the party assault Yester Hill immediately to get the gem back?
*   Now that they know about the Keepers of the Feather, how will this change their alliance with the Martikovs?
