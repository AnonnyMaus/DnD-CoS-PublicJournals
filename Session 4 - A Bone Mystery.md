# Session Overview

The party begins their investigation into the mystery of the missing St. Andral's church bones, leading them on a wild goose chase through Vallaki that ends with a dramatic revelation.

## The Narrative
Tasked with recovering the sacred bones needed to consecrate St. Andral's church, the party set out to investigate. Their first stop was a random local pawnshop where a murder had previously taken place. Instead of the bones, they discovered a bizarre collection of taxidermic animals, yielding no immediate answers to the theft.

Their investigation then pointed them toward a pair of local hunters, [[szoldar-szoldarovich-cos|Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[yevgeni-krushkin-cos|Yevgeni Krushkin]]. The hunters claimed to have a clue regarding the bones, but demanded the party fetch them three drake heads as payment before they would share it. 

The party begrudgingly agreed and went hunting, successfully tracking down and killing a white drake, a green drake, and a red drake. However, the demand proved to be a ruse; the hunters had sent them on this dangerous errand fully hoping the drakes would lead to the party's demise. While the party was distracted securing the three drake heads, Szoldar and Yevgeni attempted to make a run for it. 

Realizing the deception, the party chased down the fleeing hunters and caught them. Dragged back and interrogated, the terrified hunters finally confessed the truth: the missing sacred bones were currently being held by [[henrik-van-der-voort-cos|Henrik van der Voort]], the local coffinmaker, who had tasked them to steal the bones for a hefty amount of money. The hunters had initially stored their valuable prize with the local taxidermist, with whom they frequently traded beast carcasses. However, the taxidermist understood from context that something fishy was going on and demanded a cut. Unwilling to share the coin, and perhaps semi-accidentally, the hunters killed the taxidermist.

With the thieves apprehended, the town guard arrived to take Szoldar and Yevgeni to prison. The hunters began acting difficult, prompting the guards to threaten to fetch "Izek." The mere mention of the name caused an immediate effect—the hunters, and seemingly everyone else, were terrified of this famously tough head guard. When the brute, [[izek-strazni-cos|Izek Strazni]], finally arrived, his terrifying reputation was immediately justified: he was a massive, heavily muscled man, distinguished by a horrifying, scaly, fiendish arm that ended in razor-sharp claws. He started off very aggressively, but upon noticing Nirthar, his demonic demeanor shattered. He became dazed and grunted something along the lines of, "bro... IS THAT YOU?!"

## The Facts
*   **The Murdered Taxidermist:** The party investigated a pawnshop/taxidermist covered in blood, finding dead taxidermy but no immediate clues. It was later revealed the hunters killed him over the stolen bones.
*   **The Deadly Errand:** Hunted and killed a white, green, and red drake for the hunters Szoldar and Yevgeni, who hoped the beasts would kill the party.
*   **The Betrayal:** The hunters attempted to flee while the party secured the heads but were caught.
*   **The Confession:** Szoldar and Yevgeni confessed they were hired by Henrik the coffinmaker to steal the bones for money. 
*   **The Fear of Izek:** The town guards arrived to arrest the hunters, using the terrifying reputation of their captain, Izek Strazni, to keep them in line.
*   **The Revelation:** Upon arriving aggressively, Izek spotted Nirthar and became dazed, recognizing him as his long-lost brother.

## Open Questions
*   How will the party handle the confrontation with Henrik the coffinmaker to retrieve the bones?
*   What is the true nature of Izek and Nirthar's relationship, and why is Izek so feared?
*   How will Nirthar react to the revelation that the Captain of the Guard, Izek Strazni, is his brother?
