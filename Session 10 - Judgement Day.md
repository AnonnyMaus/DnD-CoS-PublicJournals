# Session Overview

# Session Overview

The party faces a public trial for their actions during the jailbreak massacre. After a solemn testimony by a surviving guard, Tildrak fights a trial by combat against the ghostly Warden of Flame to earn redemption. Meanwhile, a stranger named Rictavio assists Borgür with a dark ritual to control his chaotic Vrock eggs.

## The Narrative

### Judgment Day Begins

> *The bell of Saint Andral’s tolls seven slow chimes. Morning mist clings low to the stones of Vallaki, and a quiet tension hangs over the square. Townsfolk gather — some clutching hands, others arms crossed, eyes narrow. You spot familiar faces in the crowd: Danika, Urwin, even a few Vistani leaning in the shadows.*  
> *Inside the church, torches flicker. Father Lucien stands solemnly before the altar, dressed in his old ceremonial robes. His gaze is heavy, but calm. You are brought to the center of the nave. The townsfolk press in behind, a living jury.*

With heavy hearts, the party entered the church. Still unsure of Vallaki's complex politics, they decided to play it safe—Nirthar even disguised himself to watch from the crowd, though his absence at the defense stand was noted with disapproval by the townsfolk.

Father Lucien opened the proceedings with a grave address, setting the tone for the trial:
> **Father Lucien:** "Today we gather not in anger, but in search of truth. Let no one here presume guilt nor innocence. We are not here to pass vengeance — only judgment.
> In these past weeks, Vallaki has suffered. Fires. Death. Suspicion. Our hearts are heavy. But justice is not served by rumor or rage. It is served by patience, by courage, and by listening. Even now — *especially now* — no one in Barovia stands above the law."

The trial proved difficult. Unfamiliar with Barovian courts, the party made crucial mistakes by initially failing to clearly state their side of the story. 

Then came the testimony of a surviving guard. Limping and bruised, he gave a heartbreaking, hollow account of the massacre:
> **Guard:** "We were trained to deal with drunks. Riots. Not this. They didn’t fight like villagers — they fought like assassins. Or monsters... Seven of my brothers didn’t come back. Two more can’t walk. One can’t speak. I don't care about politics. I don't even care about Fiona or the Baron. But I do care about the men who bled beside me. If this town means anything... then someone has to answer for that night."

Moved by the guard's grief and the rising anger of the crowd, the adventurers finally acknowledged the terrible fault of their ways on that night, but also reminded the jury of their heroic actions saving both the orphanage and Fiona’s mansion from the resulting fires.

After a short recess, the jury delivered a twofold sentence: **A Trial by Deed** and a **Pilgrimage to Krezk**.

### The Trial by Deed
The party was directed to Vallaki's old ruined courthouse. There, the ghostly spirit of Alaric Dolan—a former paladin of Tyr who burned himself alive out of guilt after executing innocents on the Baron's orders—rose as the Warden of Flame to test the party's worth.

The party chose Tildrak to represent their innocence, and he stepped forward to face Alaric alone. It was a tense, fierce duel. Despite his martial prowess, Tildrak ultimately lost the fight. Defeated, he bent the knee, fully expecting to be executed by the fiery judge. However, his earnest prayers to Tyr and his shared sense of burden reached the Warden's broken heart. 

> **Alaric Dolan:** "Enough. I see the burden you carry. I once bore it too. Your guilt is real. But so is your will to make it right. Go. Bear the Mark. Burn cleaner than I did. Let your flame burn brighter than mine."

Tildrak emerged absolved, bearing the **Mark of Atonement**, a faintly glowing divine scar. Father Lucien then reaffirmed the second part of their sentence: a pilgrimage to Krezk. 

### The Ritual of Flesh and Feather
During the duel, an eccentric stranger calling himself **Rictavio** approached Borgür. After a brief misunderstanding about "showing him his eggs" (which involved some punches), Rictavio correctly identified Borgür's actual eggs as Vrock spawn—fragments of the Abyss. They agreed to meet behind the Blue Water Inn at midnight.

That night, the party split once more:
1. **Nirthar's Disappearance:** Nirthar was abruptly summoned to Fiona Wachter’s townhouse to discuss his brother, Izek. He departed, and then simply vanished. The party has heard absolutely nothing from him since.
2. **The Ritual:** Behind the inn, Rictavio guided Borgür, Vinarius, and Tildrak through a dangerous binding ritual. Borgür offered his own blood and pain as the "Offering of Loss," while a blessed celestial Roc feather anchored the ritual toward purity—a feather Rictavio gave them in exchange for a future favor.
Inside a fiery dreamscape, Borgür outsmarted the twin Fiends. As the ritual ended, his severed hand returned in a shifting, ghostlike state that he can control through sheer will. Only one egg hatched: a ghostly hawk—part celestial, part something else entirely—which bound itself to Borgür as his familiar. 


When the ritual concluded, Rictavio vanished without a trace, leaving Vallaki very, very quiet.

## The Facts
*   **The Sentence:** The party was found guilty of the jailbreak massacre. Their punishment was a Trial by Deed and a mandatory pilgrimage to Krezk.
*   **Atonement:** Tildrak fought the ghostly Warden of Flame, Alaric Dolan. By showing true remorse alongside his martial prowess, Tildrak earned the glowing "Mark of Atonement," absolving the group in the eyes of Vallaki.
*   **The New Familiar:** Aided by the stranger Rictavio, Borgür performed a bloody ritual that transformed his missing hand into a manipulable phantom limb and hatched a ghostly hawk familiar from one of his demonic eggs.
*   **Owed Favor:** The party owes Rictavio a significant favor in exchange for the celestial Roc feather used in the ritual.
*   **A Mysterious Disappearance:** Nirthar was summoned to meet privately with Fiona Wachter regarding Izek, and subsequently vanished without a trace.

## Open Questions
*   Where is Nirthar, and what exactly happened between him and Fiona Wachter?
*   Who is the eccentric Rictavio, and what kind of favor will he eventually ask of the party?
*   How will the treacherous journey to Krezk test the party's supposed atonement?
