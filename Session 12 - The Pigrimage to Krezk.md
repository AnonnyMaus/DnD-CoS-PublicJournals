# Session Overview

The party's pilgrimage begins with blood and betrayal as Nirthar eliminates Izek Strazni for Fiona Wachter, only to be double-crossed. A lost wager at the Vistani camp leads to a grueling task on the freezing river, where the party miraculously fishes Nirthar out of the water. Their journey to Krezk brings strange encounters, a wedding invitation from Strahd von Zarovich himself, and a very suspicious welcome at the Abbey.

## The Narrative

### The Cleaner and the Betrayal

While Vinarius, Borgür, and Tildrak accompanied Lara and Arabelle back to the Vistani and Dusk Elf encampment, Nirthar remained in Vallaki to execute a dark, secret mission for Fiona Wachter. Deep in the cellars of Wachterhaus, Nirthar confronted and murdered Izek Strazni in cold blood—despite Izek's steadfast claims that they were brothers.


The moment the deed was done, Nirthar was betrayed. He was swiftly injected with a sedative, rendered unconscious, stuffed into a coffin, and thrown into the river. Nirthar was sent on his very own, grim pilgrimage downstream.

### Sour Grapes and the Fisherman's Catch

At the Vistani camp, the party was warmly welcomed after Lara and Arabelle passionately explained how the heroes had saved them. However, Vinarius soon grew overconfident and challenged the leader, Arrigal, to a blind wine tasting. The brilliant wine-connoisseur claimed he could easily identify three distinct wines. He failed completely. 

To pay off this embarrassing wager, the party was tasked with assisting an angry fisherman named Joshuah for the day. Under the crack of Joshuah's whip, the heroes were forced to drag a heavy fishing net across the freezing river against a punishing current. The water was so bitterly cold that the party suffered levels of exhaustion. Vinarius wildshaped into an octopus to help underwater, while Tildrak noticed a heavy object snagged in the net. 


They yanked the heavy catch ashore only to find a sealed coffin. Prying it open, they discovered an unconscious—but perfectly healthy—Nirthar inside!

Furious that his catch was a person and not fish, Joshuah lashed out with his whip, striking Borgür. Tildrak attempted to tackle the angry fisherman but missed clumsily. Before things could escalate further, Borgür drew his bow and aimed. Seeing he was outmatched, Joshuah cast *Misty Step* and vanished in a puff of smoke, swearing that Arrigal would hear that the party had failed to honor their debt.

### The Long Road and a Dark Invitation

Reunited, the party traveled west toward Krezk. During their trek through the woods, they spotted "rabbit ears" behind a pile of rocks. Vinarius transformed into a rat and scouted the den, discovering a strange, purring creature sleeping within. Wisely, they chose to leave the creature undisturbed and set up camp.


During the night, while Nirthar was on watch, the mists parted to reveal **Strahd von Zarovich**. The vampire lord did not attack; instead, he casually engaged Nirthar in conversation, heavily interrogating him about what drives him and what his true motives are. Strahd also shockingly mentioned that Nirthar's parents are still alive and currently serving him at Castle Ravenloft. Before leaving, Strahd announced his impending marriage to his "kidnapped" bride, Ireena, and formally invited the party to attend the wedding, promising to send a carriage when the time was right.


The next morning, the party awoke to find their food rations completely missing from their packs. They found no obvious animal tracks, leaving the identity of the thief a frustrating mystery. 


### The Gates of Krezk and the Golden Cage

Arriving at the imposing, white walls of Krezk, the guards flatly denied them entry. Negotiations quickly fell to the Burgomaster of Krezk, who proved trained in "the art of the deal." He repeatedly reneged on his positions and terms, turning the entry negotiation into a frustrating, drawn-out ordeal. Ultimately, the party was forced to hand over all of their remaining wine as a bribe, and they had to solemnly swear an oath to bring him seven werewolf heads the very next day to deal with the town's recent werewolf troubles.

Believing their pilgrimage required them to visit the religious center, the party ascended the hill to the dilapidated Abbey of Saint Markovia. From the hilltop, they observed the town's citizens performing a grim memorial or funeral for the Burgomaster's son. 

At the Abbey, Tildrak spoke with the resident priest—the enigmatic Abbot—requesting a space to perform a small mass. The Abbot obliged, leading them into a chapel. Shortly after they entered, strange, unsettling noises began echoing from deeper within the Abbey walls. Hearing the sounds, the Abbot quickly apologized to the party and swiftly shut the thick doors behind him, locking the party inside.

## The Facts
*   **The Assassination:** Nirthar successfully assassinated Izek Strazni for Fiona Wachter, but was immediately betrayed, drugged, and thrown into the river in a coffin by her cultists.
*   **A Failed Wager:** Vinarius lost a wine-tasting bet to the Vistana leader Arrigal, leading to a clash with the fisherman Joshuah and leaving their debt to Arrigal technically unpaid.
*   **The Reunion:** The party fortuitously fished Nirthar's coffin out of the river while paying off their debt.
*   **A Royal Invitation:** Strahd von Zarovich personally visited Nirthar in the night, announcing his wedding to Ireena and inviting the party to attend.
*   **The Abbey Trap:** The Abbot of Saint Markovia allowed the party into a chapel, but upon hearing strange noises echoing from deeper in the Abbey, he quickly apologized and locked them inside.

## Open Questions
*   How will Arrigal react when he learns the party's debt to the Vistani was left unpaid after their scuffle with Joshuah?
*   Who or what stole the party's food from their camp in the night?
*   What is the true nature of the Abbot, and what are the strange noises in the tightly locked Abbey?
*   How does the party plan to respond to a formal wedding invitation from the Dark Lord of Barovia?
