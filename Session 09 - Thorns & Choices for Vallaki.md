# Session Overview

Faced with two raging fires, the party splits up to save both the orphanage and Fiona Wachter's townhouse. In the aftermath, they hand over the eternal gemstone to Lady Wachter and prepare to face a public trial for their crimes.

## The Narrative
Following the disastrous jailbreak and the resulting fires spreading across Vallaki, the party found themselves unable to choose which blaze to fight. Consequently, they split their forces: Nirthar and Tildrak sprinted toward the orphanage, while Borgür and Vinarius headed to Lady Fiona Wachter's townhouse.

**The Orphanage Rescue**
Guided by a woman named Jasmina, Nirthar and Tildrak arrived at the burning orphanage to find the doors locked and the children trapped on the upper floor. Nirthar immediately rushed inside. Outside, Tildrak used his elk and a rope to literally tear a section of the wall and window away, creating an escape route. Nirthar urged the children to jump, and Tildrak caught them safely below. A child begged Nirthar to go back inside to save someone named "Moeke." Nirthar braved the flames again but was too late, managing only to salvage the orphanage's register before escaping.

**The Townhouse Rescue**
Meanwhile, at the townhouse, two nobles were futilely trying to organize guards to extinguish the flames. Vinarius and Borgür ignored the chaos and barged inside, accompanied by one of the nobles. 

Heading upstairs, Borgür searched for a rumored diamond cross and Fiona's grandmother, but found neither. Instead, he discovered a small, encrypted black pocketbook. He initially stole the book but later decided to return it to Fiona. 
Heading down into the cellar, Vinarius found Lady Wachter unconscious and locked inside her secret research room. The accompanying noble actually held the key to the room, but deliberately dropped it, pretending it was an accident. Undeterred, Vinarius forced his way in with his "Big Key," rescuing Fiona along with several books and a translation key from her desk.


**The Aftermath and the Gem**
Reuniting at the central market, the soot-stained party was approached by Father Lucian. He sternly informed them that they must atone for their sins surrounding the jailbreak massacre. He proposed a public courtroom trial the following day to determine an appropriate punishment, and the party agreed to attend.

Later, the party gathered at the Blue Water Inn with Fiona Wachter, Danika, and Urwin to discuss the impending trial. Fiona summarized their precarious situation:
1. She acknowledged the party had earned some goodwill by helping fight the fires.
2. She stressed that the town needs closure and a feeling of justice, making their attendance at the trial critical. While she *could* sway the jury in their favor, she explicitly refused to do so. She must maintain a strict facade of legitimate justice, as she cannot appear to simply be replacing one dictator with another if her rebellion is to succeed.
3. She noted the town desperately needs a distraction from the tragedy. To that end, she somehow convinced the doubtful party to hand over the **eternal gemstone** as a deposit, promising to use it to securely import wine from the Vistani.
4. Finally, Fiona asked Nirthar for permission to "deal with" the furious Izek Strazni. Because Izek remains fiercely loyal to the Baron, Fiona needs him out of the picture to ensure the military is handled and her coup is successful. Nirthar, still flatly refusing to believe Izek is his brother, callously told her he didn't care.


## The Facts
*   **The Orphanage:** Nirthar and Tildrak successfully evacuated the children from the burning orphanage, though Nirthar was unable to save "Moeke."
*   **The Townhouse:** Vinarius rescued an unconscious Lady Wachter from her secret cellar room, unknowingly saving her occult texts as well.
*   **The Missing Cross:** Borgür searched for a diamond cross in the townhouse but only found (and briefly stole) an encrypted book of secrets.
*   **The Trial Looms:** Father Lucian has summoned the party to a public trial tomorrow to answer for their massacre at the Vallaki dungeon.
*   **The Gem Lost Again:** The party surrendered the eternal gemstone from Yester Hill to Fiona Wachter, who promised to use it to import Vistani wine.
*   **Abandoning Izek:** Nirthar gave Fiona permission to eliminate Izek Strazni, uncaring of his former brother's fate.

## Open Questions
*   What punishment will the town demand during the public trial tomorrow?
*   How will Davian and Urwin Martikov react when they discover the party gave their family's priceless winery gem to Lady Wachter?
*   What will Fiona Wachter do to Izek Strazni now that she has Nirthar's blessing?
